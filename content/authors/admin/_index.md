I am an undergraduate of the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, advised by Prof. Baoquan Chen. My research interests lie in physical simulation in computer graphics. I am particularly interested in simulating natural phenomena like fluids, solids, and elastic bodies and their applications in movies and games.
